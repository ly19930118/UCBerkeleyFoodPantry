Feature: Inventory page is properly defined

  As an UC Berkeley Food Pantry user,
  I want to able to submit what food items I want through the inventory form and be told what items I can't order, 
  So that I can get the items I want.

  Background: The new tabs template has been set up
  
  Given the following inventory items exists:
    | name               | quantity          | maximum  |
    | granola            | 10                | 2        |
    | cereal             | 20                | 1        |
    | cookies            | 8                 | 2        |
    | carrots            | 1                 | 2        |

  And the following non admin users exists:
    | userid             | orders_this_month | password |
    | cheezit            | 0                 | pass123  |
    | greedy             | 2                 | pass321  |
