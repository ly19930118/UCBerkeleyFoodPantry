Feature: make sure you can see the contact information on the page

  As a curious browser
  So that I find out how to contact the UC Berkeley Food Pantry
  I want to see contact information on the contact page

  Background: The new tabs template has been set up

  Given I am on the UCBerkeleyFoodPantry home page

  Scenario: see contact information
    When I follow "Contact"
    Then I should be on the "Contact Page"
    And I should see the page with link "ucberkeleyfoodpantry@gmail.com" to "mailto:ucberkeleyfoodpantry@gmail.com"
    And I should see the page with link "facebook.com/ucberkeleyfoodpantry" to "facebook.com/ucberkeleyfoodpantry"
